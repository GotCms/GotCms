        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
        RewriteRule ^.*$ - [NC,L]
        RewriteRule ^.*$ index.php [NC,L]
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

### Instructions

Go to the website, it will redirect you to /install.
Please follow instructions, there are only five steps:
- Language
- License
- Pre-configuration
- Database connection
- Configuration

Administration page is accessible by typing /admin after your installation path (i.e : http://yourdomain.tld/admin)

Then you can manage your website, create documents, documents types, datatypes, views, layouts, scripts, ...

All contents are stored in database.

### TROUBLESHOOTING

On Windows with wampserver, if you encounter an `403 Forbidden`:

```
<Directory "path/to/got-cms">
    Allow from all
</Directory>
```

If you have suhosin installed on your server and you can't display pages because stream wrapper isn't register, add the following line in your php.ini:
```
suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = zend.view://, gc.script://
```

or in your Apache VirtualHost configuration:
```
php_value suhosin.executor.include.whitelist zend.view://, gc.script://
```
